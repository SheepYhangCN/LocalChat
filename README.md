# LocalChat
An application that allows you to chat with others in LAN.<br>
Also a Godot network system practice<br>
Made with Godot 4 Mono<br><br>
I made this because i want to chat with my classmates in information technology class across the classroom without public network enabled.<br>
My teachers are really fond of unplugging the network cable between switcher and the router.
