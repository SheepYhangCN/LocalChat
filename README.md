# LocalChat
An application that allows you to chat with others in LAN.<br>
Also a Godot network system practice<br>
Made with Godot 4 Mono<br><br>
I made this because i want to chat with my classmates in information technology class across the classroom without public network enabled.<br>
My teachers are really fond of unplugging the network cable between switcher and the router.

## Environment Dependence
Godot 4.2.1 Stable Mono Official<br>
.NET 8.0.100 (well actually, .net8 is not necessary, if you want to use other version of .net, just change the `TargetFramework` in `LocalChat.csproj`)<br>
Inno Setup (If you want to compile ```.exe``` installer)
